# Exploring US arrest data using unsupervised learning

Project completed for final capstone of HyperionDev Data Science DfE bootcamp.

## Description

This project uses the dataset from the US Arrests Kaggle challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/kurohana/usarrets). This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents, for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.

Using this data set, I generate a similar in-depth principal component analysis (PCA) report of the data, followed by analysis using hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering techniques.
